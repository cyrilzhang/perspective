Perspective
===========

Disclaimer (since this seems to be getting a bit of attention): the code is bad, and the gameplay is really bad.
Take this with a grain of salt.

Before Apple enables WebGL outside of iAd (which may be never), this requires some sort of hack.
You can enable WebGL with a jailbroken device or a developer account.

This is meant to demonstrate a basic virtual reality system using WebGL/Three.js. It uses the iPad's
gyroscope (ondeviceorientation) events to control the player's field of view, emulating a camera.
Touch events demonstrate point picking.
